# Cuda_programming

This repository contains the code to perform the following tasks:

- Write, compile, and run C/C++ programs that both call CPU functions and launch GPU kernels.
- Control parallel thread hierarchy using execution configuration.
- Refactor serial loops to execute their iterations in parallel on a GPU.
- Allocate and free memory available to both CPUs and GPUs.
- Handle errors generated by CUDA code.
- Accelerate CPU-only applications.
